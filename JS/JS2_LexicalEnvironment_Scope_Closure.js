// The lexical environment in JavaScript 
// is a crucial concept for understanding how the language manages variables 
// and their accessibility. It's essentially a structure that 
// stores the variables and functions defined in a specific scope,
// along with a reference to its outer scope.


// Scope:
// Lexical environments are tied to the scope where code is written. 
// This means that the location of code within your file determines 
// how the JavaScript engine interprets it.


// Structure:
// A lexical environment consists of two main parts:

// Environment Record: 
// This stores the actual variables 
// and functions declared within the current scope.

// Outer Lexical Environment Reference: 
// This refers to the lexical environme`nt of the parent scope, 
// forming a chain of environments.

// Creation:
// A new lexical environment is created whenever a 
// function is defined or a new block is entered


// Accessibility:
// When a variable is accessed, the JavaScript engine first 
// looks in the current lexical environment. 
// If not found, it follows the outer environment references 
// until the variable is found or the global scope is reached


// Closures:
// Closures are functions that "remember" their lexical environment, 
// even after the outer function has finished executing. 
// This allows inner functions to access variables from their outer scope.

// Closure Simple - A Function and all the variables
// which function can take and use


// Analogy:
// Think of lexical environments as nested boxes. 
// Each box represents a scope, and inside each box are variables and functions. 
// If you need to find something, you look inside the current box first. 
// If it's not there, you look in the box that contains the current box and so on.


//Why it's important:
// Variable Scope:
// It defines where variables can be accessed, 
// preventing naming conflicts and allowing for data encapsulation.

// Closures:
// It makes closures possible, enabling powerful 
// programming patterns like function factories and private variables.

// Understanding Execution:
// It helps understand how JavaScript 
// code is executed and how variables are resolved, 
// which is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.




// ! MY TIP ABOUT CLOSURE
// CLOSURE purpose - Freeze UpLvlAbstraction (calculated on fly) data 
// for able to LowLvlAbstraction instance with its specific data 
// and specific time when its needed
// React case:
// Custom hooks, for example:
// On High Abstraction level We activate and prepare some object 
// from LIBS with some current Project High Level Data, and after that 
// we can use prepared libs stuff into 
// other target down-level places with local arguments

  // â†’ 10


// Closure for incapsulation (Caps first letter because function like OOP class)
